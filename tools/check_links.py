"""What each link of a fuzz target took, and which of that code no sanitizer instruments: a check of
`tools/check --checks`.

compile records each link of a fuzz target when tools/check asks (infra/base-builder/link-fuzz-target, "the record of
this link"): the linker's map, each file the map names with its real path and SHA-256, the driver's objects, the
copies an allocation-failure link made, and a copy of every input. This module reads those records, with no Docker,
and gives each build of each fuzz target two results:

1. The uninstrumented list, in the shape of the proofs repository's harness.yaml (builds.<build>.uninstrumented):
   each file the link took from the toolchain image, which no sanitizer instruments in any build, as in OSS-Fuzz's
   sanitizer builds: {name: <file name>, kind: libc | compiler-rt | sanitizer-runtime | cxx-runtime | fortran-runtime
   | image-library, sha256}, sorted by the file's path in the image. A file is the toolchain image's when its path is
   under /opt and the toolchain image has those bytes at that path (tools/check reads them from the image). In an
   AddressSanitizer build, an uninstrumented object is listed too, as {name, kind: assembly | fortran, source}, as
   OSS-Fuzz allows, when its DWARF says it is assembly or Fortran, or, for one assembled without DWARF, when a source
   of the project carries its name and names every global it defines. The driver (cli.o, the adapter and the seals)
   is compiled without a sanitizer in every build, by design, and is not listed.

2. Whether the project's own code is instrumented, in each sanitizer build. The project's code is every object and
   archive member the link took that is neither the driver's nor the toolchain image's. In the AddressSanitizer
   builds (asan, asan-ubsan), each one with code must refer to __asan_init or __asan_version_mismatch_check_*, as the
   constructor that AddressSanitizer adds to each instrumented object does. rustc's allocator shim, an object that only
   forwards __rust_alloc and its siblings to the standard library, is the one exception (at most one such member), as
   it makes no memory access for AddressSanitizer to check. The UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer runs in trap mode and
   leaves no symbol: its checks are trap instructions (`unimp`), and rustc's UB checks are precondition_check
   functions. So in the ubsan and asan-ubsan builds, each archive of the project's code must hold more of them than
   the same archive in the plain build, and so must the project's code as a whole.

The plain build instruments nothing, by design; its result is "plain".

What this catches: a build whose sanitizer flags did not reach some of its code, by mistake. The records are written
inside the build's own container, so a build.sh that sets out to deceive the check can; the review of the pull request
is what stands against that.
